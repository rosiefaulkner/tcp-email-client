Installation / Running the Application Instructions:
Install Python Python 3 from python.org.

Create SMTP Server:

Run SMTP server on local machine on port 25 or Postfix in OSX

Run the Python Email Script emailagent.py:
Open a terminal cd to the directory containing emailagent.py. Run the script with python3 emailagent.py

DESIGN DOCUMENT
This script is designed to send an email through an SMTP server using SMTP commands with TCP connection.

The script first creates a TCP connection to the SMTP server (this scropt uses localhost on port 25).
SMTP Commands available to user:

HELO: Allows client to be known by SMTP server
MAIL FROM: Identifies sender email address.
RCPT TO: Identifies recipient email address.
DATA: Start of message data.
QUIT: Terminates SMTP session.

The message transmission sends the email message data and ends it with a period on a new line to signal the end of the message data.

Error Handling: 

Checks server response to each command to confirm the communication is transmitting correctly.
Prints message if expected responses are not received.

Improvements to Security to be made in the future:
This implementation does not use SSL/TLS, so it transmits data in plaintext. We should instead support encrypted connections like smtplib.SMTP_SSL or smtplib.SMTP with STARTTLS.


This Python script sends an email using an SMTP server running on your local machine on port 25.
